##What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was having some trouble with push syntax prior to the GPS session but after it, I am a lot more comfortable with it.

##What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Git pull was clarified a lot more during the GPS as a combination of fetch and merge.

##What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I wasn't confident in a lot of my actions so I was asking questions about if I was doing the correct things. 

##What still confuses you about git?
What the correct syntax is for pushing to origin was confusing to me at first. I believed I had to type out the name of the repository instead of just using origin. 

##How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was similar to the peer sessions except we had a person we could ask questions to if we needed to. It is comforting to know that if we got stuck we had someone to give us some tips.
