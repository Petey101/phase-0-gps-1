#Reflection:

##What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I did not struggle with any concepts before the group pairing session.

##What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

The concept of using git fetch and git merge rather than the simple use of git pull

##What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I did not ask any questions to the guide but I will send him an email  with question that arise.

##What still confuses you about git?

I have a good understanding of git and github.

##How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

My first GPS went well. My pair and I completed the majority of the work. The guide is there to answer minor questions when they arise and offer support when we are a bit confused.
